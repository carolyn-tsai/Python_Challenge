# Python_Challenge

Unit 3 Assignment – “Py Me Up, Charlie”

For this assignment, there are 2 Python challenges: PyBank and PyPoll. 

		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

PyBank

For this challenge, I need to create a Python script for analyzing the financial records found in the “budge_data.csv” file provided. The dataset is composed of two columns: “Date” and “Profit/Losses.”

The Python script will need to analyze the records and calculate the following:

1.	The total number of months included in the dataset
2.	The net total amount of “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
3.	The average of the changes in “Profit/Losses” over the entire period
4.	The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5.	The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The script should be able to print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results. I have named my text file as “PyBank_Analysis” and it can be found in the PyBank folder. The Python script I created for this challenge will be found in “main.py” under the same folder.

PyPoll

For this challenge, I need to create a Python script for analyzing the poll data in the provided “delection_data.csv” file. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

The Python script will need to analyze the records and calculate the following:

1.	The total number of votes cast
2.	A complete list of candidates who received votes
3.	The percentage of votes each candidate won
4.	The total number of votes each candidate won
5.	The winner of the election based on popular vote

The script should also print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results. I have named my text file as “PyPoll_Analysis” and it can be found in the PyPoll folder. The Python script I created for this challenge will be found in “main.py” under the same folder.

In order to complete this challenge, I used a lot of online resources as well as materials taught in class. Along with using the activities and materials from GitLab, I also found information using the following sites:
